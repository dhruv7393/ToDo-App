# ToDo App with Drag-and-Drop ðŸ‘‹

This is a feature-rich ToDo application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) and React Native, featuring drag-and-drop functionality for organizing categories and tasks.

## Features

- âœ… **Create and manage categories** - Organize your tasks into custom categories
- âœ… **Add and manage tasks** - Create tasks with notes, due dates, and repeat options
- âœ… **Drag-and-drop reordering** - Reorder categories and tasks by dragging
- âœ… **Priority management** - Automatic priority assignment based on order
- âœ… **Task completion** - Mark tasks as done/undone
- âœ… **Repeating tasks** - Set tasks to repeat on specific days or monthly
- âœ… **Notes and due dates** - Add detailed information to tasks
- âœ… **Visual feedback** - Beautiful UI with scaling animations during drag operations

## New Drag-and-Drop Functionality

### How to Use:

1. **Reorder Categories:** Long press the drag handle (â‹®â‹®) next to any category name and drag to reorder
2. **Reorder Tasks:** Long press the drag handle (â‹®â‹®) next to any task and drag to reorder within its category
3. **Priority Updates:** Items are automatically assigned priority based on their order (1 for top, N for bottom)

### Technical Details:

- Uses `react-native-draggable-flatlist` for smooth drag interactions
- Automatic priority management with API persistence via `updateVaccation`
- Optimistic updates with error handling and state rollback
- Visual feedback with scaling and shadow effects during drag

For detailed documentation on the drag-and-drop implementation, see [DRAG_AND_DROP.md](./docs/DRAG_AND_DROP.md).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Project Structure

```

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
